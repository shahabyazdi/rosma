      "Rosma is a lightweight and easy-to-use global state management library designed for React applications. It offers three essential APIs for managing your app's state: `observer`, `useObserver`, and `withState`.",
      "Unlike other state management libraries, Rosma is incredibly easy to set up and use. it is written in such a way that it does not require an initial and sometimes complicated setup. Simply install it via npm (`npm i rosma`), and you're good to go.",
      "One of the key advantages of Rosma is its simple naming convention for variables and setter methods. To set a setter method for a variable, all you need to do is prepend the variable name with the `set`. For instance, after setting a value for the `count` variable, you would name the corresponding setter method `setCount`.",
      "Rosma's `observer` class allows you to declare global state variables and update them from anywhere in your application. `useObserver` provides a simple way to consume these global state variables in your functional components, while `withState` is a higher-order component that enables based components to access the global state.",
      "Overall, Rosma is a powerful yet straightforward state management library that simplifies the process of managing your app's state. Try it out today and see how it can improve your development workflow."
